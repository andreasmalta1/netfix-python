# netflix-python

A program that loads a ViewingActivity.csv file downloaded from Netflix.
The program shows a menu that allows the user to select four options:
  1. View your total viewing time on Netflix
  2. Check your viewing activity by day of the week
  3. Check your viewing activity
  4. Search for a show/movie and view the total viewing time and viewing activity by day and hour for that show
  5. Exit the program

All you need to do is download your viewing activity from Netflix.

Since Netflix might take a while to provide this info a sample .csv file is included
